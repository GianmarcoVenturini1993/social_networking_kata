# social_networking_kata
Exercise repo in Java


Solution to given exercise

Instruction for running the application:
1-in the project folder, go to ".jar" directory:
	something like: >cd social_networking_kata/out/artifacts/social_networking_kata_jar
2-you'll find a .jar file: to run it from terminal (macOS or Linux):
	>java -jar social_networking_kata.jar
3-now you're running the application, please refer to the original instruction to play around with it; just know that to stop the application you have to press enter without entering any valid command. This was a plus to ensure that whenever the user want to exit the application, he must not press ctrl+c (mac), but much more simply he just doesn't feed the input any new command.

Enjoy:)
