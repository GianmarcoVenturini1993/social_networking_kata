# social_networking_kata
Exercise repo in Java - Solution to given exercise

#Introduction

The solution was created in Java language (Java 8); just a simple application
that can be run from console (later on we'll come to the instruction for running the application).
The given trace didn't include any user creation procedure, so everything is based on what was written in the draft.
Note that the application is designed for future changes, such as user creation and indexing in a global map.
Due to the simple nature of the project, it was chosen not to use any particular enterprise Java framework, that could have been the
go-to choice for a more complete modular (REST) application.

#Instruction

Instruction for running the application:

1-in the project folder, go to ".jar" directory:
	something like: 
	
	>cd social_networking_kata/out/artifacts/social_networking_kata_jar
	(you can copy this file outside for stand alone application run)

2-you'll find a .jar file: to run it from terminal (macOS or Linux):

	>java -jar social_networking_kata.jar
	
3-now you're running the application, please refer to the original instructions on the trace to play around with it; 
just know that, in order to stop the application, you have to press "Enter" without entering any valid command. 
This was a plus to ensure that whenever the user want to exit the application, he does not have to press ctrl+c (mac), 
but much more simply he just doesn't feed the input any new command.

Enjoy:)
